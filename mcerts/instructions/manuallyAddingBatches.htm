<h1>How to manually add batches to the MCERTS system</h1>

<h3>Step 1:</h3>

<h3>Step 2 :</h3>
<p>Enter the <strong>Equipment ID</strong> of the machine into the text box next to &quot;Equipment ID&quot;. This is a number. e.g 356 or 158</p>
<p>The Standard Deviation (precision) % and Target Bias % must be as in the MCERTS documentation. </p>

<h3>Step 3:</h3>
<p>Enter concentrations for all your batches. For each batch the date and time must be unique. e.g. Dates 3/4/2005 00:00 and 3/4/2005 00:00 for replicate 1 and replicate 2 respectively would be incorrect because they are identical. Dates 3/4/2005 14:00 and 3/4/2005 15:00 are acceptable values. </p>
<h3>Step 4:</h3>
<p>Click the 'Add Matrix' button when you have entered your batches. </p>
