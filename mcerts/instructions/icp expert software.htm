<h1>ICP Expert  Software (Vista machines)</h1>
<h3>Setting up the Machine </h3>
<p>The *.sws files that the machine creates <strong>must</strong> be saved  into a folder with the name EIDXXX, where XXX is the equipment id of the machine.</p>
<p>(The EIDXXX folder does not have to be the immediate parent folder of the save location, i.e C:\EID345\DATA\1 is acceptable)</p>
<p>To do this a new folder on the computer must be created. It can be created anywhere on the computer. </p>
<p>E.g.
  For each run follow these steps:
</p>
<p>1. Click File    </p>
<p>2. Click Save As      </p>
<p>3. Choose a folder C:\DATA\EIDXXX\ (replace XXX with equipment id)        </p>
<p>4. Click Save. </p>
