<p>Before starting a run, the “Data File Directory” on the above screen must contain the EID as a folder in the format  EIDXXXX. </p>
<p>Where XXX is the equipment id of the machine.</p>
 <p>e.g:   	C:\MSDCHEM\1\DATA\EID123\JULY\2807 or
	    C:\MSDCHEM\1\DATA\EID345\JULY\2807</p>
 <p>Before the first time this is done a new folder named EIDXXX will need to be created somewhere on the computer.</p>
 <p>The path you enter in the &quot;Data File Directory&quot; text box will contain the <strong>'epatemp.txt' </strong>file that contains the data. This is the file that needs to be uploaded.</p>
 <p>Failure to include EID in the Data File Directory will prevent the results from being added to the system.</p>
