  <h1>The Correct Format of MCERTS Sample Names</h1>
  <p>The sample name must remain the same for each CRM within all the batches. Do not include any information in the
    sample name that indicates which run (replicate) the sample is from. i.e. Do not include �a�, �b� or 1 at the end of
    a sample name. </p>
  <h3>Certified Reference Materials (CRM) </h3>
  <p>The sample name for a Certified Reference Material(CRM) is its Catalog No appended to its Lot No. The Catalog No
    and Lot No can be obtained from the CRM's Certificate of Analysis. </p>
  <p>e.g:
    If a CRMs Catalog No is CRM613-030 and its Lot No is BE613, then the sample name should be entered into the computer
    as: CRM613-030BE613 (no spaces)</p>
  <h3>Matrix Spikes and Other non CRMS..</h3>
  <p>Sample names for matrix spikes must remain consistent throughout. E.g. If you have decided to use �mcerts soil ms
    20%� as the sample name then you must use that for all the batches.
    Problems are created when alternative spellings are used for the same spike, such as : </p>
  <p>mcerts soil 20% </p>
  <p>mcerts ms soil 20% </p>
  <p>ms soil 20% </p>
  <p>Ideally the sample name should contain as much identifiable information as possible unique to that sample so that
    the sample can be easily traced in the future if need be. </p>
