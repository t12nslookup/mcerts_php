  <h1>How to view a validation summary report
  </h1>
  <p>There are 2 types of summary:</p>
  <p>1. <strong>Pass/fail summary</strong> : this summary shows passes and fails for each analyte in each reference
    material.</p>
  <p>2. <strong>MCERTS Summary</strong> : this summary is a more detailed version of the pass/fail summary report. It
    shows the actual bias and precision values for each analyte. This is the summary that MCERTS require from us. </p>
  <p>A summary report must be created before it can be viewed. Also whenever the data in a validation is changed (ie.
    new batches added, batch selection alters or new data added) then a summary must be recreated. </p>
