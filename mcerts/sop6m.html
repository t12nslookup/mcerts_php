This standard operating procedure (SOP) describes the procedures
followed in the analysis of soils/sediments and waters for the
determination of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) content by
GC/FID at Manchester and by GC/FID &amp; GC/MS at Warrington.
<P>
Due to the difficulties in
sub-sampling liquids from sample containers that may contain floating
product or particulates, sampling into a 'grab' bottle is strongly
recommended. The laboratory then reports the result upon the whole
content of the bottle.
<P>
The concentration range covered by the method will depend on the
sample size and final extract volume. The linear range should lie
between 10 and 20000 ng injected. Note that the lower limit of
linearity is dependent on attainment of the necessary GC / GCMS
response (as appropriate).
<P>
For the purposes of this method TPH is defined as all hydrocarbons
extractable by the method within the carbon range from circa C
<SUB>
8
</SUB>
to circa C
<SUB>
35
</SUB>
. This range is appropriate for the
determination of contamination caused by products such as diesel,
fuel oils, heating oils, lubricating oils, paraffin/kerosene and
white spirit. This method is
<B>
not
</B>
 suitable for the analysis of
gasoline range organics.
<P>
Speciation is performed by reference of the chromatograms obtained
to those of standards of a number of petroleum products (see appendix
C). When speciation is required a solution containing a range of
n-Alkanes, ranging from C
<SUB>
10
</SUB>
 to C
<SUB>
28
</SUB>
, is analysed
to allow identification of carbon number ranges. This is the MDRO
standard that is used for qualitative purposes only.
<P>
Hydrocarbon banding is
performed by speciating the 'total' extracts into aliphatic and
aromatic fractions as described (
<A HREF="#Determination of TPH Aromatic  Aliphatic Splits in the range C10-C35">
</A>
<A HREF="#Determination of TPH Aromatic  Aliphatic Splits in the range C10-C35">
Determination
of TPH Aromatic  Aliphatic Splits in the range C10-C35
</A>
<A HREF="#Determination of TPH Aromatic  Aliphatic Splits in the range C10-C35">
</A>
), currently there are four bands for each fraction, &gt; C10-12, &gt;
C12-16, &gt; C16-21, &gt; C21-35. Matrix spike samples are processed
at the same time.
<P>
It should also be noted that
calibration is performed using a mineral oil mix. This standard is
prepared as a 50:50 mix of Mineral Oil A (additive free diesel) and
Mineral Oil B (additive free lubricating oil).
<P>
In real samples a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic
hydrocarbons may be present. Although a diesel standard is routinely
used for analysis purposes, comparative analysis of a variety of
fuels/oils has been performed and similar response diesel has been
observed.

The method involves microwave, ultrasonic or liquid-liquid
extraction of the test sample, followed by concentration, prior to
analysis by capillary gas chromatography with flame ionisation or

Ongoing checks on
method precision are provided via analyses of blank samples and
matrix spiked samples. Additionally, standard B (5000ng/ul) shall be
run at the beginning and end of every batch of analysis. The
performance data obtained must agree with the limits of method
precision outlined in

samples shall be re-extracted or re-analysed. A CRM or spiked matrix
sample is analysed on a monthly basis and the results plotted on AQC
charts.

sub-sample has been taken for the TPH measurement. The
reproducibility of this cannot be assured and therefore this result
should be considered to be semi-quantitative.&quot;

Determination of TPH Aromatic /
Aliphatic Splits in the range C6-C35.

The limit of detection when
following this procedure is circa 250 mg/kg for soils and circa 25
mg/l for waters.

<P>
10 +/- 0.1 g of the sample
`as received` is weighed directly into a 40 ml vial.
<P>
Add 2 +/- 0.1 ml of methanol
and shake for approximately 5 minutes.
<P>
Add 10 +/- 0.1 ml of pentane
and shake for approximately 5 minutes and allow to settle. If
necessary add 1-2 ml of deionised water to aid the separation.

Column
Chromatography
</H4>
<P>
A chromatography column is
prepared as follows. A glass chromatography column (300 mm x 10.5 mm
id) is plugged with a small amount of cleaned glass wool. The column
is packed with, from the bottom, separate layers of: 8 g activated
silica gel (100-120 mesh); 1 g activated alumina (100-250 mesh,
Brockmann type 1, neutral). The column is pre-washed with 30 ml
pentane. Discard the eluate. Columns may be prepared and stored until
required for use, however when this is the case, they are not
pre-washed until immediately prior to use.
<P>
Check the column for air
bubbles or channelling. If present, tap the column to remove.
<P>
The crude sample concentrate
is dissolved in 1 ml of pentane. This - together with two further 5
ml pentane rinses - is applied to the top of the pre-washed column,
taking care that each pentane rinse has passed onto the column prior
to introducing the next rinsing. After the sample has been applied,
the column is eluted with 20 ml pentane. The eluate is collected in a
100 ml beaker marked with SAL sample number and 'aliphatic fraction'.
<P>
The solvent system is now
changed to pentane:dichloromethane (DCM) 50:50 (v/v). The beaker
which contained the crude sample concentrate is rinsed with 5 ml of
pentane:DCM 50:50 (v/v) and this - together with two further 5 ml
rinses - is applied to the top of the column. The column is eluted
with 20 ml pentane:DCM 50:50 (v/v). The eluate is collected in a 100
ml beaker marked with the SAL sample number and 'Aromatic Fraction'.
<P>
The collected fractions are
concentrated to incipient dryness in a fume hood and then transferred
to 2 ml vials in dichloromethane. The solvent is then allowed to
evaporate at ambient temperature.
<P>
<I>
Note: Care should be
taken not to allow the extract to become completely dry as
naphthalene may be lost.
</I>
<P>
Resuspend all extracts in
1.0 ml (+/- 0.05 ml) of DCM and cap the vial.
<P>

30 +/- 0.3 ml of the sample
is transferred to a 40 ml vial.
<P>
Add 3 +/- 0.1 ml of pentane
and shake for approximately 5 minutes.
